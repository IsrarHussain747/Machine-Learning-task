Iris Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Overview

This project performs an exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset, a well-known dataset in machine learning and data science. The dataset consists of measurements of three species of iris flowers: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica, with features including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

Objectives

Load and explore the dataset.

Perform data visualization to analyze patterns and relationships.

Identify insights using statistical and graphical methods.

Methodology

Data Loading & Exploration

Read the dataset using Pandas.

Examine its structure, check for missing values, and analyze data types.

Data Visualization

Scatter Plot: Sepal length vs. sepal width to visualize species separation.

Histogram: Distribution of sepal length with Kernel Density Estimation (KDE).

Results & Findings

Clear distinctions were observed between species in the scatter plot.

The histogram revealed the normal distribution of sepal length.

No missing values were found, ensuring clean data for further analysis.
